# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create a transparent, educational interface that empowers users to understand their financial behavior while maintaining strict ethical boundaries. The experience should feel supportive and informative, never judgmental or sales-focused. Users should clearly see the data signals driving every recommendation and have full control over their consent and data processing.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Consent-first flow**: No data processing occurs without explicit user permission with clear revocation options
- **Transparent rationale display**: Every recommendation shows the specific behavioral signals that triggered it
- **Time-window comparison**: Users can toggle between 30-day and 180-day views to understand short-term vs. long-term patterns
- **Education-focused content**: All recommendations emphasize learning and improvement, not product sales
- **Operator oversight**: Human review capabilities for quality assurance and ethical compliance

## Core Screens and Views

1. **Consent & Onboarding Screen**: Clear explanation of data usage with explicit opt-in
2. **User Dashboard**: Personalized view showing assigned persona, detected behavioral signals, and recommendations
3. **Behavioral Signals View**: Detailed breakdown of subscriptions, savings, credit, and income patterns
4. **Recommendations Feed**: 3-5 education items and 1-3 partner offers with rationales
5. **Operator Review Interface**: Administrative view for oversight, approval/override, and decision traces
6. **Evaluation Dashboard**: Metrics and fairness analysis for system performance

## Accessibility

WCAG AA compliance - system should be accessible to users with diverse abilities

## Branding

Clean, trustworthy financial services aesthetic with emphasis on transparency and education. Use calming colors (blues, greens) to convey stability and support. Avoid aggressive sales imagery or language.

## Target Device and Platforms

Web Responsive (primary), with consideration for future mobile app deployment
