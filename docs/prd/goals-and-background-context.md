# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Build an explainable, consent-aware AI system that transforms Plaid-style transaction data into actionable financial insights
- Detect behavioral patterns from financial transactions and assign users to educational personas
- Deliver personalized financial education with clear guardrails around eligibility and tone
- Demonstrate a fully auditable, modular, and fair personalization framework
- Empower users to understand and improve their financial behavior without providing regulated financial advice
- Create a system that prioritizes transparency, user control, education, and fairness

## Background Context

Banks generate massive transaction data through Plaid integrations but struggle to turn it into actionable customer insights without crossing into regulated financial advice. The challenge is to build a system that respects user consent, provides transparent explanations for every recommendation, and maintains strict ethical boundaries. This project aims to demonstrate that financial technology can be both powerful and trustworthy, putting user education and empowerment ahead of product sales.

This is an individual or small-team project with no strict deadline, focused on building a production-quality demonstration of responsible AI in financial services.
